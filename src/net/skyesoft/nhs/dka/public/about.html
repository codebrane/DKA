<center><h2>Information about the Audit of the use of New DKA protocol online application</h2></center>
<p>
  When you first open the website, you will see a drop down list on the left which lists all the previously entered study
  data. If there are no previous studies in the online database, the list will say <strong>No previous data</strong>.
  If there is previous study data available, just select its name in the list and click on the button marked <strong>Load</strong>
  and the previous data will be loaded into the application. You can then edit and save this data.
</p>

<p>
  When you are ready to save new study data, or save previously loaded data that you have modified, all you have to do is
  click on the button marked <strong>Save</strong>. This will save all the data you have entered. The application will store
  this data under the value of the <strong>Study No</strong> field you entered in the <strong>General</strong> screen.
  If you refresh the browser after you have saved your data, you will see the new <strong>Study No</strong> appear in the list
  of previous study data. You can then load it whenever your require.
</p>

<p>
  <h2>Things not to do</h2>
  As the application runs in your browser, there are a few things you should be aware of. If you don't do these things your
  data should be safe.
  <ul>
    <li>Do not refresh the browser page unless you have saved your data. Refreshing the page will clear all the fields
    you have previously entered. If you have to refresh the browser, save your data first. If you have only entered
    some of the data, you can load it later and continue entering it.</li>
  </ul>
